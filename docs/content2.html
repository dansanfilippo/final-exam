            <h5 class="card-title">What happened to IE after becoming dominant?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Microsoft was innovating web browsers from IE3 until IE6 and was far beyond Netscape.
              Microsoft’s browser could handle much more CSS than Netscape could, in fact Netscape could barely render a
              table. Netscape 4.0 was so buggy and slow that it was leaps behind what Microsoft was putting out. So
              where did the problems begin</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card float-left">
          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">To begin Microsoft essentially established itself as an evil empire in the tech world.
              It did this by integrating IE into Windows as a required component, and then on top of that they made it
              very difficult to uninstall and use a different browser. Most people realized that this was a clear
              attempt to put Netscape out of business</p>
            <p class="card-text">The next thing Microsoft did was stop trying. Since their control was so dominant and
              there was no competition, they did nothing to IE for five years, and since Firefox was released during
              this time and was much better, people started leaving. </p>
            <p class="card-text">Microsoft also made it so that they had their own specific features that didn’t follow
              web standards. As the only web browser, this wasn’t a problem, but as new and better browsers were
              released, this became a burden to web developers. </p>
            <p class="card-text">IE had so many bugs. Internet Explorer was so filled with bugs and security holes
              because Microsoft just stopped trying. It was so bad that </p>
            <p class="card-text codetext"> &lt;script&gt;for(x in document.write){document.write(x);}&lt;/script&gt;</p>
            <p class="card-text">This one line of code could crash IE</p>
            <p class="card-text">IE 7 and 8 were too late. It took five years of a terrible IE6 until IE7 was released
              and the problem was web developers hated it. Since IE7 was so different in standards, web developers had
              to make two different pages to render correctly on different browsers.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Then, when IE8 was finally released another two and a half years later, most people had
              already moved on, and IE 10 and 11 were a lost cause</p>
