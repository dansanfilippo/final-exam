            <p class="card-text">The original browser wars were a competition and
              a race to create the best web browser. In mid-1995, Netscape was the standard browser at the time as it
              was the first mass-market browser. Microsoft seeing this success,released Internet Explorer 1.0, and then
              three months later
              Internet Explorer 2.0, and with this release the race began. </p>

        <div class="card float-left">
          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Over the next few years versions of each browser were released in rapid succession,
              opting for features over bug fixes. Due to this choice, the browsers were riddled with bugs and were very
              unstable, causing tons of problems for the user. It took until Internet Explorer 3.0 in 1996 for Internet
              Explorer to be equivalent to Netscape’s capabilities. Then in 1997, with Netscape still controlling nearly
              3/4s of the browser market, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4.0. IE 4.0 was faster and was in line
              with the W3C’s specifications stricter than Netscape 4.0 was. This release shifted the tides of the
              browser wars. Microsoft had two commanding advantages in this war. One was it was a much bigger company.
              Netscape was a financially vulnerable company and would never even come close to the giant that was
              Microsoft. The second advantage Microsoft had was it had a monopoly over operating systems and used this
              to boost IE’s growth. Every copy of windows was bundled with IE and as Microsoft caught up to Netscape in
              the capabilities of its browser, it became useless to download Netscape if you already had a computer with
              IE. IE remained dominant for years and peaked in 2002, where it controlled 96% of all web browser usage,
              significantly more than Netscape ever did.</p>
